cd /var/www/html
echo "This is server" > index.html
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
sudo su -

Goto VPC
Now, open peering connection
-> create peering connection -> Name -> VPC ID -> my account -> another region -> select destination region -> enter destination VPC ID -> OK

Goto to peering connection in other region accept it 

Edit route table -> public route table -> edit route -> add route -> if given 10.0.0.0/16 so we have to put 20.0.0.0/16 -> peering connection 

do above step in both regions 

-> save changes

In Terminal: 
Go to public instance of both region 
ping (jo opposite terminal ke heading me likha hai wo ip dalna hai, - ko hata ke . dalna )(private ip of opposite private instance)
